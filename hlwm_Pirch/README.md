# Pirch
Pirch (Pi + Arch) is my lightweight herbstluft rice for Raspberry Pi 4. There are few differences between the rice and the base herbstluft *autostart* files in order to maintain efficiency. zRAM is used to boost the speed of the Pi for more demanding applications. A Raspberry Pi logo is used as the background, with the colors of the Raspberry Pi logo making up the color scheme for the rice. Mixes of inconsolata and Source Code Pro fonts are used throughout the rice, and the "slate" theme is used for gvim in particular.

Basic Requirements:
 - Raspberry Pi 4
 - x-server (xorg, xorg-init, etc.)
 - Source Code Pro, Font Awesome 5 (ttf), Inconsolata
 - gvim
 - dzen2 (workspace bar)
 - dmenu and networkmanager\_dmenu (application runner)
